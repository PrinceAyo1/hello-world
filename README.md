# hello-world
My first repository
Hi everyone, I am absolutely new to Computing and ICT as a profession, and I am hoping I am not too late to this party, even though I am past my 40s. 
I am doing some udemy courses, and a friend suggested I put all my work, however little or huge on Github, so people can see my development. 
I am interested in web development, web design, programming, algorithms, and communication technologies
